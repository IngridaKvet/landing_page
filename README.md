# landing_page
A another webpage made during the foundations course on the Odin Project using HTML and CSS. <br>
This repo contains all the files needed for example website described in The Odin Project's "Foundations" curriculum.
The aim of this project was to create a simple webpage made of 5 sections.<br>
What I learnt: completing this project allowed me to practise working with Git and Github, creating simple HTML elements, adding some style with basic CSS and Flexbox. <br>
